## Adulthood is More Stressful Than Childhood  

&emsp;People grow up and face different challenges at each stage of life. Childhood is a time of fun and learning, but adulthood comes with many responsibilities. **From my point of view, I agree with the idea that adulthood is more stressful than childhood.** Some people say children have school, homework, and rules, so their life is difficult. _**However, I believe adults have more responsibilities, make harder decisions, and face many problems in life.**_  

&emsp;**First of all,** adults have more responsibilities than children. They have to work, pay bills, and take care of their families. If they do not do these things, they will have serious problems. On the other hand, children do not worry about money or family responsibilities. Their parents take care of everything, so life is easier for them.  

&emsp;**Secondly,** adults must make many important decisions. They need to choose their jobs, where to live, and how to solve problems. If they make a wrong choice, it can create big troubles. However, children do not make such big decisions because their parents guide them.  

&emsp;**In conclusion,** I believe adulthood is more stressful than childhood because adults have more responsibilities and must make difficult decisions. _While_ childhood has some problems, adults face bigger challenges. **As a result,** life gets harder and more stressful as people grow older.

# Family is the Most Important Influence  

&emsp;Family is the most important influence in a person’s life. From a young age, family teaches us how to behave, speak, and make decisions. Parents and siblings help us learn good values like honesty, respect, and kindness. Because of this, family has a strong effect on a person’s development.  

&emsp;First, family teaches children important life skills. Parents help their children learn how to talk, eat, and take care of themselves. They also teach good manners, like saying “please” and “thank you.” These small lessons help a child grow into a responsible adult. If a child grows up in a loving family, they will learn to be kind to others.  

&emsp;Second, family gives emotional support. When a person feels sad or confused, family members are always there to help. They give advice, comfort, and love. This support helps a person become strong and confident. A person with a caring family will feel safe and happy in life.  

&emsp;In conclusion, as I have said above, family has the biggest influence on a person’s life. They teach important skills, give love and support, and help shape a person’s character. Because of this, family is the most powerful influence on a person’s development.
