Everybody has a dream house. Like everybody, I also dream of having a gorgeous house in the future. In my opinion, everyone deserves a good house, and my dream house is in Bodrum because I love Bodrum. My dream house is big and has a garden, and it also has a view of the sea. I love the sea because it is very pretty and it makes me feel relaxed. My dream house is white with a red roof, and it has many windows. I like windows because they make the house sunny.  My house has a big kitchen, and I like to eat, so I want to cook in my big kitchen.  My house has four bedrooms. One bedroom is for my mom and dad, and two bedrooms are for my siblings. Finally, one bedroom is for me, and my bedroom is blue, which is my favorite color. I like to play outside, so my house has a big garden where I can play. Moreover, I can have a dog, and my dog can play with me. I am happy in my dream house. In conclusion, it is a good house because it has everything I want.
