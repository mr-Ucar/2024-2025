F1's Greatest

Michael Schumacher was a very famous race car driver from Germany who loved racing even when he was a child. He started racing in Formula 3, which is like a school for Formula 1, and then he raced in Formula 1 for a team called United Colors of Benetton. He won his first big race in 1992 in Belgium, and he won again in 1994 and 1995. From my point of view, Schumacher was very ambitious and wanted to win! He went to a team called Ferrari, which was not winning many races, but Schumacher helped them win again! He became very popular and won his last big race with Ferrari in 2004. Schumacher retired in 2006, but he came back to race with Mercedes in 2010. He retired again and tried other sports because he loved exciting sports! Sadly, he had a bad accident while skiing in 2013. Consequently, Schumacher never gave up on his dreams. He loved racing, and he was very good at it. He is an inspiration to many people. That is why he is my favorite sportsperson.
