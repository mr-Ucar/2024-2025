                                                  Wrestling

There are many popular sports in my country, which is Turkey. Football, basketball and wrestling are people's favorite sports here. Of all popular sports in Turkey, I would like to express my opinions about my favorite sport, wrestling. Wrestling is very popular in Turkey. It is not like in other countries. From my point of view, wrestling is very important to Turkish people. It is a very old sport in Turkey.  Even Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Republic of Turkey, loved wrestling and supported wrestlers. Moreover, you can see wrestling in many festivals and celebrations.  Wrestlers try to show how strong they are.  Turkey has many world champion wrestlers, like Yaşar Doğu and Hamza Yerlikaya. Besides, people love to watch wrestling.Consequently, as I said above, wrestling is not just a sport in Turkey. It is part of our culture.
