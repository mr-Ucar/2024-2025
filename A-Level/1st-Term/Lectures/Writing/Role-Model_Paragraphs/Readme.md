             MY FAVORITE SPORTSPERSON

  My favorite sportsperson is a volleyball player. Her name is Eda Erdem DÃ¼ndar. We call her "Captain" because she is the national team captain. She is from Istanbul and she is 37 years old. Eda's height is 1.88 cm. She has black and long hair. I think her hair is very beautiful. She was chosen as the best player of last year and received an award, and she has a lot of awards like this. She loves talking and gives a reportage after the match. In my opinion, she is one of the best volleyball players in the world. I advise playing volleyball because it is a lovely game.
