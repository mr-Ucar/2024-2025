             MY FAVORITE SPORTSPERSON

  My favorite sportsperson is a volleyball player. Her name is Eda Erdem DÃ¼ndar. We call her "Captain" because she is the national team captain. She is from Istanbul and she is 37 years old. Eda's height is 1.88 cm. She has black and long hair. I think her hair is very beautiful. She was chosen as the best player of last year and received an award, and she has a lot of awards like this. She loves talking and gives a reportage after the match. In my opinion, she is one of the best volleyball players in the world. I advise playing volleyball because it is a lovely game.

## WRITING TOPIC: Common Qualities of Good Parents

  Being a good parent is a significant responsibility. **In my opinion,** the common features of good parents are treating their children well to build a good life and a positive future. Spending quality time with children and engaging in meaningful activities together is essential. Good parents listen to their children, try to find solutions to their problems, and offer support in various ways. Parents should teach their children to learn from their mistakes and help them distinguish between right and wrong. Above all, parents should show love and respect to their children. Mutual respect between parents and children is crucial for a happy and peaceful family life. **Consequently,** by embodying these qualities of support, guidance, love, and mutual respect, parents can cultivate strong, healthy relationships with their children and contribute to their overall well-being.
