**The Present Perfect Tense is used to talk about actions that started in the past and continue to the present, or actions that happened at an unspecified time in the past.**

**How do we form the Present Perfect Tense?**

_We use `have/has` + the past participle of the verb._ 

### Examples


I **have played** football. _(This means I played football at some point in my life, and I might still play it now.)_ </br>
She **has eaten** breakfast. _(This means she ate breakfast at some point in the past, maybe this morning.)_ </br>
They **have gone** to school. _(This means they went to school and are still there now.)_ </br>
